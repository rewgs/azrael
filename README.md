# Reaify - Rewgs' Extension for the Reaper API. 

Reaify is a library that provides a more object-oriented approach for interacting with the Reaper Lua API.

## What's with the name?

The name is also a play on the word "reify," which is adjacent to "objectify," as well as a play on the fact that nearly every extension made for Reaper starts with the letters "rea."
