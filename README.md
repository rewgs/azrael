# Reaify - Rewgs' Extension for the Reaper API. 

Reaify is a library that provides a more object-oriented approach for interacting with both the Reaper Lua API, as well as the Ultraschall API. 

Powers the [`rea`](https://github.com/rewgs/rea) script library.

## Setup
<!-- TODO: Handle this in init.lua -->
1. Install the [Ultraschall API](https://github.com/Ultraschall/ultraschall-lua-api-for-reaper). This library heavily relies on it.
