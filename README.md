# Reaify - Rewgs' Extension for the Reaper API. 

Reaify is a library that provides a more object-oriented approach for interacting with both the Reaper Lua API, as well as the Ultraschall API. Powers the [`rea`](https://github.com/rewgs/rea) script library.

## What's with the name?

The name is also a play on the word "reify," which is adjacent to "objectify," as well as a play on the fact that nearly every extension made for Reaper starts with the letters "rea."
